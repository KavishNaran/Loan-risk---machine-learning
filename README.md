# Introduction

This project utilised machine learning to analyse a fincancial dataset in order to predict if an individual will experience backrupty using using there input information.

# Process and dataset

The dataset consisted of the following varibles: Loan ID, Customber ID, Current Loan amount, Term, Credit score, Annual income, Years in current job, Home ownership and bankrupty.

1. Data import and cleaning
2. Data Standardization
3. Machine learning models
4. Data analysis
5. Visualisation

# Models

- Random Forest:
An ensemble method that builds decision trees and merges their predictions, often improving overall accuracy of the models.

- Neural Networks:
Deep learning models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes and are used for complex tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

- Ensemble:
A machine learning technique that involves combining the predictions of multiple models to improve overall performance and generalization.
